# Convolutional VAE for the OASIS dataset of 2D brain scan images

This notebook is based on the TensorFlow guide for CVAEs provided at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cvae.

This was completed as a way to practice working with images in TensorFlow Datasets, to try out GradientTape to define a training loop and to use data in Google Drive to train inside of Google Colab.

The script below relies on the OASIS dataset being loaded into a Google Drive account.
